  "situationSnapshot": "CAVA stands at a once-in-decade cultural and category convergence: Mediterranean fast-casual ($14.2B market, 10.8% CAGR) has no national competitor, Gen Z's $2T wellness revolution prioritizes functional nutrition over restrictive diets, and ethnic cuisine mainstreaming ($49.8B global market, 8.6% CAGR) validates bold flavors. The company's operational excellence—352 units generating $954M revenue (+35.1%), 18.1% comps, 12.9% traffic growth, 25.6% margins—proves product-market fit. But 67% awareness in mature markets versus competitors' 90%, and only 40% in new geographies, creates growth bottleneck requiring aggressive brand-building.\n\nThe strategic imperative is **speed and authority**: reach 700-1,000 units by 2028 establishing \"CAVA = Mediterranean\" mental availability before Chipotle (3,600 units, $88B market cap, operational mastery) launches Mediterranean offerings or private equity funds franchised imitators. Flavor Seekers—adventurous Gen Z/Millennials who treat meals as identity expression, cross-shop 5-7 fast-casual brands monthly, and demand health + flavor + customization simultaneously—are cultural unlock if converted from occasional visitors (1-2x/month) to weekly loyalists (2-3x/week).\n\nThree strategic priorities drive this: (1) **Mediterranean Authority Campaign** positioning CAVA as category expert through ingredient sourcing, chef credibility, and health science partnerships before competitive collision; (2) **Flavor Seeker Loyalty Gamification** converting promiscuous cross-shoppers into habit through progression systems, creator partnerships, and community challenges; (3) **Geographic White Space Acceleration** opening 80-100 units annually (vs. current 56-58) in high-density Flavor Seeker markets (college towns, adventure sport hubs, urban cores) ahead of competition.\n\nInvestment requirement: $250-300M over 36 months ($180M unit expansion, $50M marketing acceleration, $20-30M technology/data). ROI projection: $400-500M incremental revenue by 2028, $80-100M EBITDA contribution, sustaining 15%+ unit growth and 22%+ restaurant-level margins. Risk mitigation: Chipotle's Mediterranean entry (monitored quarterly), economic downturn trade-down (value menu hedges), social media algorithm shifts (owned channel diversification).\n\nThe window is open but closing—Mediterranean fast-casual is where Mexican was in 2008 (10 years pre-Chipotle's explosive growth). CAVA must execute land-grab now or face permanent #2/#3 positioning behind better-funded entrants or major player category consolidation.\n\n---",
