    "summary": "Food has transcended sustenance to become Gen Z identity expression—\"foodie\" ranks top 3 self-descriptors alongside music/gaming, with 84% trying social media food trends and 70% using TikTok for restaurant discovery. The $2T wellness industry is experiencing \"Gen Z glow-up\": 30% prioritize wellness \"a lot more\" than last year, driving functional nutrition (73% consume for energy), longevity focus (preventative health at young ages), and mental health integration (42% put \"very high priority\" on mindfulness). Cultural tension exists: Gen Z vocally supports sustainability (70% say it's important) but behaviors lag (fast fashion, convenience over ethics). Mediterranean diet's #1 ranking, ethnic cuisine explosion ($49.8B market, 8.6% CAGR), and authenticity obsession create perfect conditions for CAVA—if brand bridges aspiration gap between values and actions through frictionless wellness dining.",

  "situationSnapshot": "The wellness revolution has generational architects: Gen Z and Millennials comprise 36% of U.S. adult population but drive 41% of wellness spending, fueling a $23.5B industry in 2023 (McKinsey). Their approach differs from predecessors—wellness is daily personalized practice (sleep tracking, functional nutrition, mental health apps, preventative skincare) versus occasional activity. [Source: https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/consumer-packaged-goods/our-insights/future-of-wellness-trends] 73% consume functional foods for energy, 61% for mental wellbeing, 40% for better sleep. Longevity products target younger consumers taking \"proactive approach to healthy aging\"—cognitive and metabolic health investments starting in 20s, not 50s.\n\nFood sits at wellness intersection: Mediterranean diet ranked #1 by U.S. News for 2025, with 71% of Americans increasing protein consumption (up from 59% in 2022), and Gen Z driving demand for \"flavorful healthy products\" like lentils, chickpeas, sweet potatoes in Mediterranean/Latin/Asian dishes. [Source: https://clf.jhsph.edu/viewpoints/food-trends-2025-focus-healthful-foods-viral-trends-and-protein] The cultural narrative shifted from \"restrictive diets\" (keto, paleo) to \"functional nutrition\"—foods delivering specific benefits (gut health, immunity, mental clarity) while tasting indulgent. Mediterranean cuisine's inherent both/and nature (olive oil provides healthy fats + richness, vegetables provide nutrition + volume, proteins provide satiation + variety) perfectly aligns.\n\nEthnic cuisine mainstreaming reflects generational diversity: U.S. ethnic food market reached $25.6B in 2024, projected $46.5B by 2032 (7.23% CAGR). Global ethnic foods hit $49.8B, reaching $113.6B by 2034 (8.6% CAGR). [Source: https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/us-ethnic-food-market] Drivers include \"increasing multicultural influences, rising immigration rates, and evolving consumer preferences for diverse culinary experiences.\" Gen Z's cultural curiosity extends beyond tolerance to active exploration—50% want meals with unique flavors from different cuisines, 32% love trying new foods. Mediterranean's regional diversity (Greek, Lebanese, Turkish, Israeli) provides endless exploration substrate while maintaining health credentials.\n\nSocial media transformed dining from private to performative: \"foodie\" is Gen Z top-3 identity marker (with music, gaming), and food choices signal values, cultural awareness, and social status. [Source: https://foodinstitute.com/focus/gen-z-stakes-its-claim-as-the-foodie-generation/] 70% use TikTok for restaurant recommendations, 52% tried new restaurants based on social feedback, and 64% eat out weekly averaging $51 per visit. When food trends go viral, participation feels like \"joining shared cultural experience\"—FOMO drives trial, peer validation sustains repeat. Restaurants aren't just feeding customers; they're providing content moments and identity markers.\n\nCultural tension emerges between values and behaviors: while 70% of Gen Z cite sustainability as important and embrace flexitarian lifestyles, actual purchasing shows \"disconnect between stated intentions and behavior.\" [Source: https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09669582.2025.2491702] They grapple with \"materialism versus responsible consumption\"—desire for self-expression and social status (fast fashion, trendy dining) conflicts with environmental/ethical ideals. The tension creates opportunity for brands making virtuous choices frictionless: CAVA's Mediterranean positioning (inherently plant-forward, sustainable diet, authentic cultural cuisine) lets them feel good while indulging, resolving the cognitive dissonance.\n\n---",
