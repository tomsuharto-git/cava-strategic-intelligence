      "implication": "CAVA demonstrates category-defining resilience as the Mediterranean Chipotle, maintaining strong unit economics ($2.9M AUV, 24.6% margins) despite macroeconomic headwinds that slowed same-store sales growth to 1.9% (down from 18.1% prior year). The critical story: new 2025 units are performing above $3M AUV with 100%+ productivity, proving national scalability even as mature markets normalize. At 415 units (17 Q3 openings) with 67% awareness in mature markets, CAVA's path to 1,000 units by 2032 depends on aggressive brand-building converting awareness into trial. Industry traffic declined 3.3% while CAVA stayed flat—this is market share gain, not stagnation.",

  "situationSnapshot": "CAVA operates 415 company-owned Mediterranean fast-casual restaurants (up from 352 one year ago) on track to generate $1.2B+ in fiscal 2025 revenue (+20.0% YoY in Q3 2025). The business model mirrors Chipotle—assembly-line customization with premium ingredients—but introduces bold Mediterranean flavors (harissa honey chicken, house-made hummus, tzatziki, new chicken shawarma) to differentiate from saturated Mexican and salad segments.

Critically, the 2025 new unit cohort is trending above $3M AUV with productivity exceeding 100%, demonstrating \"brand's portability and resonance across the country.\" The company opened 48 net new restaurants through Q3 2025, on pace for 68-70 annual openings, targeting 1,000 units by 2032. [Source: https://investor.cava.com/news/news-details/2025/CAVA-Group-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx]\n\nThe macro reality shift: Q3 2025 same-store sales growth decelerated to 1.9% (versus 18.1% prior year) with guest traffic approximately flat. However, this represents market share gain as industry traffic declined 3.3%. Revenue growth of 20.0% demonstrates the power of new unit expansion offsetting mature market normalization. Digital strength continues at 37.6% of sales, supporting $3M+ AUVs through omnichannel convenience. [Source: https://investor.cava.com/news/news-details/2025/CAVA-Group-Reports-Third-Quarter-2025-Results/default.aspx]\n\nThe growth challenge remains awareness: only 67% in CAVA's most mature market (DC/MD/VA) versus 90% for established chains, dropping to 40% in new markets. The company increased marketing spend 15% in 2024, prioritizing streaming ads and social media (25% follower growth, 30% engagement lift from UGC campaigns). With new units proving strong economics nationwide, the bottleneck is brand recognition, not unit-level viability.
