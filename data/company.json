      "implication": "CAVA demonstrates category-defining resilience as the Mediterranean Chipotle, maintaining strong unit economics ($2.9M AUV, 24.6% margins) despite macroeconomic headwinds that slowed same-store sales growth to 1.9% (down from 18.1% prior year). The critical story: new 2025 units are performing above $3M AUV with 100%+ productivity, proving national scalability even as mature markets normalize. At 415 units (17 Q3 openings) with 67% awareness in mature markets, CAVA's path to 1,000 units by 2032 depends on aggressive brand-building converting awareness into trial. Industry traffic declined 3.3% while CAVA stayed flat—this is market share gain, not stagnation.",
