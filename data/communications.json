      "implication": "CAVA has cracked Gen Z's unhinged marketing code through self-deprecating humor (calling bowls \"slop\"), creator partnerships (DJ Mandy, Emma Chamberlain), and user-generated content amplification—achieving 3.3M active digital users (+22% YoY) and viral moments (3.7M likes from single influencer post). The brand's digital-first strategy pivots toward streaming ads (YouTube TV, Roku, Hulu) to escape TikTok algorithm dependence and build sustainable awareness in new markets (40% baseline). Voice is confident yet playful (\"let's get bold,\" \"broc my world\"), resonating with adventurous Flavor Seekers who want brands that feel like friends, not advertisers. Gap: lacks consistent POV on Mediterranean heritage and culinary expertise—leans too heavily into memes versus category authority, risking commodity positioning versus Sweetgreen's wellness leadership and Chipotle's Mexican authenticity.",
