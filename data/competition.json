      "implication": "Q3 2025 earnings reveal CAVA's competitive advantage crystallizing: while CAVA delivered +1.9% comps (flat traffic vs. -3.3% industry), Chipotle managed only +0.3% comps with declining dinner traffic, and Sweetgreen cratered at -9.5% comps (13.1% margins vs. CAVA's 24.6%). All three cite identical macro pressures—25-35 age group down 15%, low-income pullback, geographic weakness (Northeast, LA)—but CAVA's Mediterranean positioning and new unit excellence ($3M+ AUV) demonstrate superior resilience. Chipotle's existential threat remains (3,600 units could test Mediterranean LTOs), but their current struggles buying time. Sweetgreen's collapse (selling Infinite Kitchen tech to Wonder, slowing to 15-20 openings from 37) removes flanking wellness pressure. Strategic implication: CAVA must accelerate brand-building now while competitors are distracted by their own crises, establishing Mediterranean category ownership before macro environment improves and competitive intensity returns.",

Tier 1 giants—Chipotle ($88B market cap, 3,600 locations, $2.79B Q3 revenue) and Sweetgreen (246 locations, $676.8M annual revenue)—dominate fast-casual mindshare and wallet-share. Chipotle's 33M loyalty members dwarf CAVA's 4.8M, while their historical 27.2% restaurant-level margins represent operational mastery CAVA aspires to.

With 3,600 units, operational mastery, and brand recognition (90%+ awareness), Chipotle could test Mediterranean LTOs or launch a sub-brand. Their current struggles (+0.3% comps, declining dinner traffic) buy CAVA time, but when macro environment improves, Chipotle's scale and resources could rapidly validate Mediterranean category and attract investment to weaker competitors or new entrants. The question is \"when, not if\" for Mediterranean category collision. CAVA must establish category ownership (\"Mediterranean = CAVA\" mental availability) before competitive intensity returns. Strategic imperative: accelerate unit growth (80-100 annually vs. current 68-70) and brand-building (closing awareness gap from 67% mature/40% new to 90% baseline) during this 18-24 month window while giants are distracted.\n\n[Source: Competitive analysis synthesis]",
