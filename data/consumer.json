    "summary": "Flavor Seekers are adventurous Gen Z/Millennial fast-casual regulars (18-34) who treat meals as experiences, not transactions. They over-index massively on adventure sports (Index 641 snowmobiling, 496 rock climbing), emerging social platforms (Index 382 BeReal), and cultural exploration (Index 355 R&B/Hip-Hop concerts)—signaling thrill-seeking personalities who extend their boldness to food. 84% try social media food trends, 73% actively seek new cuisines, and 71% prioritize health-conscious restaurants. They're cross-shopping Chipotle, Sweetgreen, Shake Shack—hungry for the next format that balances flavor + health + customization. CAVA's Mediterranean positioning hits their sweet spot, but loyalty requires constant menu innovation and frictionless digital experiences.",

  "situationSnapshot": "Flavor Seekers represent CAVA's core customer base: Gen Z-dominant (18-29 primary, extending to Millennials 30-40), urban/suburban, middle-to-upper income fast-casual regulars who've made Mediterranean bowls their go-to lunch ritual. MRI-Simmons data reveals they're 200% weighted CAVA customers, meaning they visit at twice the rate of average consumers—and their behavioral fingerprint is unmistakable. [Source: _CONSUMER-DATA-Flavor-Seekers.md]\n\nTheir psychographic profile defies stereotypes. Yes, they're health-conscious (71% actively seek restaurants prioritizing health), but they're equally thrill-seeking: 641 index on snowmobiling, 496 on rock climbing, 434 on obstacle races. They attend R&B/Hip-Hop concerts (355 index), play paintball (355), kayak/canoe (362), and were early BeReal adopters (382)—a constellation of behaviors signaling adventurous, socially connected, experience-driven personalities who refuse to compromise on any dimension of life. [Source: _CONSUMER-DATA-Flavor-Seekers.md]\n\nFood decision-making mirrors this multidimensionality. 73% like trying new cuisines, 50% want more meals with unique flavors, yet 71% of restaurant-goers 20-29 actively seek health-conscious options. [Source: https://www.supplysidefbj.com/market-trends-analysis/keys-to-food-beverage-product-success-for-gen-z] They're not choosing between taste and wellness—they demand both. Mediterranean cuisine solves this tension: bold harissa flavors + fresh vegetables + customizable proteins + health halo from global diet rankings.\n\nSocial media dictates their restaurant discovery and frequency. 84% try social media food trends, 70% use TikTok for food recommendations, 55% visit restaurants after seeing menus on TikTok. [Source: https://www.fb101.com/why-84-of-gen-z-are-trying-social-media-food-trends-and-what-that-means-for-restaurant-marketing/] Instagram and TikTok have replaced Google/Yelp as primary research tools. They're checking feeds, watching creator reviews, and seeking Instagram-worthy moments before deciding where to eat—making visual appeal and shareability non-negotiable.\n\nLoyalty is earned through value (60% prioritize discounts/deals) and convenience (38% need seamless apps/ordering), but brand allegiance is fragile. They're cross-shopping Chipotle, Panera, Chick-fil-A, Shake Shack, Five Guys, Sweetgreen—willing to switch for better experience, novelty, or perceived value. [Source: https://www.fastcasual.com/blogs/loyalty-programs-what-customers-value-most/] Fast casual is their default (36% cite as preference vs. 26% family-style, 15% bar/grill), with 53% ordering more than a year ago.
